LightPcapNg

This repository is forked from https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus (directory 3rdParty) which itself forked from https://github.com/rvelea/LightPcapNg

Since we wanted to preserve the git history, it is best to clone just for the LightPcapNg subdirectory by running this command:
```
git clone --single-branch -b pcapng https://github.com/stricaud/LightPcapNg
```

Library for general-purpose tracing based on PcapNg[1] file format.
The current project represents work in progress to provide an API
that can read, write and manipulate PcapNg files (possibly outside
normal contexts).
